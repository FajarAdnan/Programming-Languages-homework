# Programming-Languages-homework
This repo contains all my homework assignments for Programming Languages

Each assignment is contained within a folder labled with the assignment number.

# HW3 Notes
HW3 was completed in two parts. Part 1 is for the lambda assignment. Part 2 is for the coins assignment.

# To run:
1. Please go to the folder "cd /Users/name/Downloads/Programming-Languages-homework-master/hw3-part1" (or where the download was saved to)
2. Open a terminal in this folder
3. Type "cargo run"

The code is stored in the main.rs file within each folder.
